# Discord-BSD-0.0.25
An updated and fixed version to the other port of Discord-BSD ( credits to the pervious owner for the idea)

# Updates

- Fixed Linking issues
- Added extra warnings
- Removed bloat from this repo (cleanup)

# Note

- The version number will be the same as the one for electron ( I might change this later and include a auto updater )
# Bugs
- 1 Download Links may open a blank window, do not close it or discord will close with it! 


- Certain links open up in a window for you to preview ( might be useful rather than opening a new window on your default browser, though its still a bug! Take it as you wish.)
